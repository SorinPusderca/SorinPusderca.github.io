            I'm not afraid of new
            challenges and aspects of life.I'm a strong believer
            in technology and the direction it has to change the
            world. I strongly believe I have the necessary skills
            and qualities needed to carry out my duties.
            My current job wasn't offering the possibility to
            grow and to fulfill my full potential, as well as the
            desire to learn new technologies and interact
            with people..</p>

        <p>Working with technologies such as HTML5, CSS3,
            Vanilla JavaScript but also frameworks like ReactJS. I managed learn and to create various applications,
            such as my version of the 1978 Space Invaders game and the Gecko Client app, and other projects for which
            I'm working on. <br>For
            example, I had no clue without JavaScript, 90% of Internet webpages would be static. Major apps
            like Facebook, Instagram, Netflix and others are constantly improving their experience and adapting to new
            frameworks and trends. </p>

                How did we end up together?
                In truth..I was intrested in Taz's older brother. When I entered the room where all the puppies were,
                Taz was the first
                to jump on me.
                And as long as I was with the puppies, Taz was climbing on top of me, biting my clothes, constantly
                getting my attencion.
                I guess.. it was love at first sight for him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Taz and I are inseparable, we often go on quite long hikes together. Regardless of the weather and how
                dangerous it can become, and yes, there were times when we encountered wild animals, but that's to be
                expected..</p>
            <p>
                He doesn't miss a single second, always on guard, ready to act to show his loyalty. Sometimes I wonder
                if he's brave or unaware of the danger he's in. And just like in a team, the task is always shared.
                He is the shining and the light, he is the force that made me be.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The motorcycle was originally built in Japan and intended for export in Canada. In the summer of 2019, I
                bought it from the Netherlands. Back then I didn't know exactly what I was buying, after researching the
                motorcycle I found out that
                the G type was produced only in 1985 and comes from the factory equipped with the 45-degree V-twin VR51B
                engine
                that develops 63 horsepower. Starting with 1986, her sisters GLP/GLF received the same engine with only
                55
                horsepower with and some lucky GL's and F variants reciving the 63 horsepower engine.</p>
            <p>She had a hard life until I bought her. All is not lost with this one, in the
                fall of 2019, a mechanical and
                tinsmith intervention took place. Being "isolated" in a town. I
                downloaded the repair manual from the internet and ordered the necessary parts.. from Japan.
                With a lot of care and mechanical knowledge combined with sleepless nights, 4 weeks later and a new
                shade of paint, new shotgun exhaust pips she was ready to blast through the streets. It was challenging
                but I
                managed, alone, to bring her back to life.

            </blockquote>
            <p>It's been a while since I played drums in my twenties.
                I was on fire back then.. you know how it is, you must be the best drummer in your band.
                It was cool back then, I played drums in three different bands adopting styles such as jazz,
                blues, punk, metal and heavy metal. One of them was in Sibiu right after I finished my
                studies. At the same time, we opened for thrash metal bands from Brazil on tour in Europe. After a short
                time we entered an event called "Escape in arts" in which me and members received first place. </p>
            <p>Like many good things, they end at some point, and unfortunately the bands broke up. In my free time I
                still practice, sometimes I miss a note or two.. rusty but not worn. </p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>
                So far everything is good. I managed to stay intact. As a rule, the trails I choose for mountain biking
                are quite complex, many have stones and roots that can perforate the tire. And when it rains even
                better, the grip decreases decently and the risk of injury increases..
