            <p>Father of a brave and clever 4 year old American Bully named Taz</p>

            <p>
                This "puppy" is not a ordenery one. Taz is a cross between American
                Bulldog, English
                Bulldog, Olde English Bulldogge and American Pit Bull Terriers. These breeds are considered dangerous.
                In
                fact, this is the case if you are an irresponsible owner and don't know how to educate your dog, this
                happens to any breed, regardless of it's size.
            </p>
            <p>
                Taz and I are inseparable, we often go on quite long hikes together. Regardless of the weather and how
                dangerous it can become, and yes, there were times when we encountered wild animals, but that's to be
                expected..</p>
            <p>
                He doesn't miss a single second, always on guard, ready to act to show his loyalty. Sometimes I wonder
                if he
                is brave or unaware of the danger he is in. And just like in a team, the task is always shared.
                In truth.. He is the shining and the light, he is the force that made me be.

            <p>1985 Suzuki Intruder VS750 G.</p>
            <p>
                The motorcycle was originally built in Japan and intended for export in Canada. In the summer of 2019, I
                bought it from the Netherlands. Back then I didn't know exactly what I was buying, after researching the
                motorcycle I found out that
                the G type was produced only in 1985 and comes from the factory equipped with the 45-degree V-twin VR51B
                engine
                that develops 63 horsepower. Starting with 1986, her sisters GLP/GLF received the same engine with only
                55
                horsepower with and some lucky GL's and F variants reciving the 63 horsepower engine.</p>
            <p>She had a hard life until I bought her. All is not lost with this one, in the
                fall of 2019, a mechanical and
                tinsmith intervention took place. Being "isolated" in a town. I
                downloaded the repair manual from the internet and ordered the necessary parts.. from Japan.
                With a lot of care and mechanical knowledge combined with sleepless nights, 4 weeks later and a new
                shade of paint, new shotgun exhaust pips she was ready to blast through the streets. It was challenging
                but I
                managed, alone, to bring her back to life.

            <p>Playing the drums.. I still think I can do it.</p>
            <p>It's been a while since I played drums in my twenties.
                I was on fire back then.. you know how it is, you must be the best drummer in your band.
                It was cool back then, I played drums in three different bands adopting styles such as jazz,
                blues, punk, metal and heavy metal. One of them was in Sibiu right after I finished my
                studies. At the same time, we opened for thrash metal bands from Brazil on tour in Europe. After a short
                time we entered an event called "Escape in arts" in which me and members received first place. </p>
            <p>Like many good things, they end at some point, and unfortunately the bands broke up. In my free time I
                still practice, sometimes I miss a note or two.. rusty but not worn. </p>

            <p>Mountain biking on trick trails</p>
            <p>
                So far everything is good. I managed to stay intact. As a rule, the trails I choose for mountain biking
                are quite complex, many have stones and roots that can perforate the tire. And when it rains even
                better, the grip decreases decently and the risk of injury increases..
